do some type checking when inserting variables into the symbol table
consolidate numericLit, charLit, and stringLit into a single class? Perhaps THIS is what is meant by a constant inheriting from an esxpression. YES, probably. I've been allowing constants to be expression all along, I've just labeled then as numericLit, charList, and stringLit, and pull them all into different classes.
