### Refactor ###
replace typeIndicator with an enum

### Next time ###
Move on with the rest of the simple expressions, (including making the ability to over write basic types for badidea.cpsl. ug).
Finish the constructor in a prelude.

### Assumptions ###
The product of multiplcation will never require accessing mfhi

### Questions ###

### Known Bugs ###
changing value->typeIndicator to value->getTypeIndicator() in LookUpItem.cpp results in a seg fault

### Possible Bugs ###

#### TO DO ####
check types as they go into the symbol table
figure out where to put type, offset, and base register, definiatively
do () expression
* after all expression are emitting, verify that in all their constructors they define their typeIndicator


##### NOTES #####
Type Indicator:
0 = int
1 = char
2 = string
3 = boolean
4 = array
5 = record
